   <h1>Fatphobia in Society</h1>
   <p>Although beauty standards have varied greatly throughout history, constantly going between different body types to decide which one is the most “desirable,” there has been a consistent body trend within the past few decades of beauty. This trend being that it is more desirable to be on the thinner side. The desire of being skinny has created a fatphobic society that many people deem unfair since being bigger does not necessarily equate to being unhealthy. Marie Southard Ospina explores this issue further in her article, Lockdown Has Exposed How Embedded Fatphobia Is In Our Society. She writes of her experiences regarding fatphobia, especially during the COVID pandemic lockdown. Ospina talks about her friend who is on the skinnier side but is known to embrace fat-acceptance and the hypocrisy she finds in her friends’ actions. Her friend claims to support fat acceptance, yet ostracizes her own body when she gains a little weight. Similarly, she notes an increase of weight gain jokes that have been sparked due to the COVID lockdown, such as “joking” about signing up for the TV show, My 600-lb Life, when the pandemic is over. These few examples demonstrate how fatphobia has been rooted into our societal thinking of assuming “being fat is bad.”</p>

<h1>Body Positivity Movement</h1>
<p>While fatphobia is prevalent in today’s society, there are those who have decided to challenge the stigma and fight against the harmful beauty standards that society has placed on women. One of these movements is called the “Body Positivity Movement.” The goal of this movement is to address how body image can affect people's mental health and self-perceptions. Many people often place their self-worth on their physical appearance; this movement wishes to remind everyone that no matter the body type, every body is beautiful and worthy of love. According to the article, What Is Body Positive?, by verywellmind.com, some issues that can result from having poor body image consist of depression, low self-esteem, and eating disorders. </p>

<p>The Body Positive Movement can be traced back to the 1960s during the time of the fat acceptance movement. Meanwhile, the term “body positive” appeared during 1996 when a website called, thebodypositive.org was founded by a psychotherapist and patient who had been treated for an eating disorder. The site’s goal was to provide educational materials to help people feel good about themselves and decenter the idea of needing to lose weight through unhealthy means. In 2012, the movement began to evolve into what it is known as today. While the movement originally started as a protest against unrealistic female beauty standards, it soon shifted to an idea focused on weight acceptance and reminding people that “all bodies are beautiful.”</p>

<h1>Body Neutrality Movement</h1>
<p>A second movement on the rise is known as the Body Neutrality Movement. It originally stemmed from the Body Positivity Movement around 2015 by health and wellness bloggers, Gabi Gregg and Stephanie Yeboah. One of the main concerns regarding the Body Positivity Movement is that while the message seems pure-hearted, it felt exclusive to many because it gave the impression that you could only celebrate body positivity if you fit into a certain body type. Many people of color, disabled, transgender, and non-gender conforming people felt excluded by the movement. While Body Positivity promotes loving your body, Body Neutrality focuses on accepting your body as it is and what it does for you, rather than focusing on its appearance. An example of this was done by Kate Winslet who revealed that she opted out of photoshopping herself during her role on the HBO series, Mare of Easttown, because she felt that embracing her natural self brought her closer to the role she was playing. As stated in an article by Firstpost, she says she played a “fully functioning, flawed woman with a body and a face that moves in a way that is synonymous with her age and her life and where she comes from.”</p>
